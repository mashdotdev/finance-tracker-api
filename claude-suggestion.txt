Project: Smart Expense Tracker API
A personal finance API where users track expenses, set budgets, and get AI-powered spending insights. It's practical, relatable, and exercises every concept from the course — without repeating the task manager.

Why this project
Different domain than the course (finance vs tasks)
Real-world complexity: aggregations, date filtering, budget vs actual comparisons
Natural fit for streaming AI advice
Multi-table relationships (users → expenses → categories)

API Endpoints

POST   /users/signup
POST   /token

POST   /categories          # Create category (Food, Rent, etc.)
GET    /categories
DELETE /categories/{id}

POST   /expenses            # Create expense with amount, category, date, note
GET    /expenses            # With filters: ?category=Food&month=2026-02
GET    /expenses/{id}
PUT    /expenses/{id}
DELETE /expenses/{id}

GET    /budgets             # Get all budget limits
PUT    /budgets/{category_id}  # Set monthly limit for a category
GET    /summary             # Spending vs budget per category this month

POST   /advisor/chat        # Non-streaming AI chat
POST   /advisor/stream      # SSE streaming AI financial advice
The Interesting Parts
GET /summary — this endpoint is non-trivial. It has to:

Aggregate expenses by category for the current month
Compare against budget limits
Return over/under budget status
This forces you to write real SQL queries with SQLModel's select() + func.sum(), not just basic CRUD.

The AI advisor agent gets tools like:

get_spending_summary() — total by category
get_top_expenses(n) — biggest purchases this month
get_budget_status() — which categories are over budget
Then a user can ask: "Where am I overspending?" or "Can I afford a $200 dinner this weekend?" and the agent queries the real data.

Suggested Build Order
Models: User, Category, Expense, Budget
Auth routes (signup + login)
Category CRUD
Expense CRUD with date filtering
Budget endpoints + /summary aggregation
Middleware + lifespan
Write pytest tests for all endpoints
Add AI advisor tools as wrapper functions
/advisor/chat (non-streaming)
/advisor/stream (SSE)
Stretch Goals (when the above is solid)
GET /expenses/export — returns CSV via StreamingResponse
Recurring expenses (weekly/monthly auto-entries)
Multi-currency support with a live exchange rate fetch at lifespan
A second agent: a "savings goal" tracker that estimates how long to reach a target
One Rule
Don't look at the course's capstone while building. Write your spec.md first, list your success criteria as checkboxes, then implement against it. That's the real skill being tested.
